# Types of Acquisitions 

**1. Horizontal:** When you acquire a competitor.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;   E.g. You are McDonalds and you acquire Burger King.   

**2. Vertical:** When you acquire a supplier, distributor or vendor.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;  E.g. You are Ford and you acquire a steel company (Ford needs steels for their cars.)  

**3. Market Extension:** When you acquire a company with a similar business model/product in a different geographical market.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;  E.g.  You are Starbucks and you acquire Luckin Coffee in China (the Chinese equivalent of Starbucks.)  

**4. Product Extension:** When you acquire a company with a similar product but targets a different audience.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;  E.g. You are Rolex (high-end luxury watches) and you acquire Timex (everyday, mass-market watches). (Same product, different audience/price point.)  

&nbsp;&nbsp;  E.g. You are Ford (mass-market cars/trucks) and you acquire Land Rover (luxury, off-road SUV niche).  

**5. Conglomerate:** When you acquire a company in a different industry like how Berkshire Hathaway does

&nbsp;&nbsp;  E.g. You are Amazon and you acquire a Hotel. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;  E.g. You are GE (jet engines, power grids) and you acquire FOX (TV network).
