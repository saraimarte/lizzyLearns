Here's how companies might have tried to "commit fraud" or, more accurately, aggressively manipulate earnings before clearer standards or enforcement

Historical "Abuses" or Aggressive Accounting Practices

Before stricter interpretations and regulations, companies might have engaged in practices that effectively inflated their reported revenue or profits, even if they didn't fully "own" a company for the entire period. These weren't necessarily outright "fraud" in every case, but rather highly aggressive or misleading accounting.

"Pro Forma" Abuse and Misleading Metrics:

The Problem: Companies would selectively use "pro forma" figures (as if they owned the company for the full year) in their earnings press releases, but sometimes wouldn't clearly distinguish these from their official GAAP numbers. They might emphasize the higher pro forma revenue without adequate explanation, making it look like they had more organic growth than was actually reported.

How it was Used: A company that acquired another halfway through the year could tout its "pro forma" full-year revenue for the acquired entity, leading investors to believe the reported GAAP revenue was higher or that growth was stronger.

The Fix: Regulations now require very clear reconciliation of non-GAAP (pro forma) metrics to GAAP numbers, with GAAP numbers always being the primary reported figures. In simple words, you are not allowed to record the revenue company owened for the year in your fiscal year until you actually own the company.

Why the Cash Flow Statement Exists (and Why EBITDA is Not Enough)

The fundamental reason the Cash Flow Statement must exist is because a company's profit (EBITDA or Net Income) is not the same as the actual cash in its bank account.

EBITDA is an excellent measure of Operating Profitability, but it is purposefully designed to ignore many things that are major movements of real cash.

Think of it this way:

1. EBITDA Ignores Working Capital (The Day-to-Day Cash)

Scenario: A company makes a $1,000,000 sale.

P&L/EBITDA View: The Income Statement immediately records that $1,000,000 as revenue, making the EBITDA look great.

Cash Flow View: If the customer is given 90 days to pay (creating an Accounts Receivable), the company has zero cash from that sale today. The Cash Flow Statement will show that the cash hasn't arrived yet.

The Point: A company can have high EBITDA but go bankrupt because it runs out of cash waiting for its customers to pay or for selling its slow-moving inventory. The Cash Flow Statement captures these day-to-day timing issues.

2. EBITDA Ignores CapEx (The Money Needed to Stay in Business)

Scenario: A manufacturing company has an EBITDA of $5 million.

EBITDA View: The $5 million looks good. Since EBITDA adds back Depreciation (which relates to past asset purchases), it makes the company look like it can keep all that money.

Cash Flow View: The Cash Flow Statement shows that the company had to spend $4 million (Capital Expenditures, or CapEx) to buy new machines just to replace old, broken ones.

The Point: After paying for necessary equipment (CapEx), the company's real cash available for debt or owners is only $1 million. The Cash Flow Statement shows the CapEx, revealing the true cost of staying in business, which EBITDA completely misses.

3. EBITDA Ignores Taxes and Debt Payments (The Mandatory Costs)

EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.

Interest and Taxes are very real, mandatory cash payments. You must pay the government and you must pay the banks.

Crucially, when a company pays back the principal of a loan (not just the interest), that mandatory cash outflow is nowhere on the Income Statement or in the EBITDA calculation. The Cash Flow Statement captures all these debt repayments, showing how much cash is actually being drained by the company's debt structure.

In summary: EBITDA tells you if a business is theoretically profitable; the Cash Flow Statement tells you if the business is actually liquid enough to survive and grow. Cash is king, and the Cash Flow Statement tracks the king's movement.



# Income Statement 

<RuleBox>
**Def.** An <Pop t = "statement of operations, earnings statement, or profit and loss statement (P&L)">**income statement**</Pop> is an overview of the revenue and expenses <Pop t = "collected"> incurred </Pop> during a specific time period (e.g. 1/1/2021 to 12/31/2021.) It's useful when analyzing the profitability generated by the firm.  
</RuleBox>

**1. Revenue** <Pop t = "# of items">Volume</Pop> * Price  
**What matters:** How did revenue change as a percent (not as a dollar amount) year over year ("YoY")
**Why did it change?**
Volume increase/decrease?
Price increase/decrease?
Acquisition related?



We record transactions based on accrual not cash. 

We record changes in revenue and expenses when a transaction occurs but before money is received or given away. 

We record changes in revenue and expenses when a transaction the cash related to that transaction has been reveived. 

E.g. I buy a computer on credit.

# Cash Flow Statement 

<RuleBox>
**Def.** A **cash flow statement** is cash accounting. It answers the question, "what caused changes in the Company's cash balance during the year?"

# Balance Sheet


<RuleBox>
**Def.** A **balance sheet** is a snapshot in time of the assets and liabilities of the company. The time period is one day (e.g. 12/31/2021)

So far we have been given assumptions. 

TO put together a financial model you are making assumptions (educated guesses) regarding the company:

Revenue 
Gross Margins
Operating Expenses etc.

If they are not good then your model is trash.

After you're working with a model there are two seperate 

Base Case: the scenario you believe is the most likely outcome.

Sensitized Projections: This is the companys downside. You would tie it to the risks which you have identified earlier on in class. 

Identified risks in companys business model (base case)

If those risks are realized how would it impact the company (Sensitized projections)


The downside scenerio
